    "# Abstract \n",
    "Goal is to predict whether a stock price in the S&P500 will move up or down based on a tweet. To do this a dataset composed of financial tweets will be combined with a dataset of the stock prices of all S&P500 companies broken down into 4 or 6 hour blocks to allow for some level of intraday price change analysis. This will be accomplished with a classification model such as KNN. Performance will be measured by the percentage of cases that the model can correctly predict from the test dataset.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is relevant because with companies like Robin-Hood and M1-Finance popping up in recent times and making stock market investing accessible to anyone with the knowledge to download a smartphone app, that opens the doors to social media marketing tactics that could potentially move prices by creating a mob of retail investors that act in unision. This is enhanced with the introduction of fractional investing offered through these platforms which allows an investor to purchase a fractional amount of a share, removing the barrier for low-capital-retail-investors to invest in companies that have a high price per share. These tactics can be any combination of covert/overt and unintentional/intentional to the human eye but perhaps there are underlying patterns that the right machine learning algorithm can caputre."

    "- This dataset has 943,672 observations with two variables per observation. An observation consists of a date-timestamp and the content of a tweet made at that time. The first part of is to change the column names and make sure the datatypes are set up correctly. This dataset contains tweets about many different stocks but no way to tell what stocks a given tween is talking about without looking into the tweet, so I create a new column in the dataset where each entry is an array of all words in the tweet beggining with the $ symbol, this symbol signifies stock tickers on twitter.\n",

Each CSV is set up the same way, they have 7 variables and 10440 observations. An observation represents a price activity on that day, the observation lists the data, open and close prices, Low and high prices, and volume. The cleaning done to these datasets is to truncate all dates outside of the range of our tweets dataset, which only spans about 3 months, and then to normalize all of the numerical price data.\n",
